Revision history for Module-Patch

0.10    2012-08-03 (SHARYANTO) (not yet released)

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Change patch_data format (v => 3) because we switch from using
          Monkey::Patch to Alt::Monkey::Patch::SHARYANTO to support
          add/replace/delete (aside from wrap). When using the latter, first
          argument given to wrapper code is not $orig (original subroutine) but
          $ctx (context hash, original subroutine is in $ctx->{orig}).


0.09    2012-07-17 (SHARYANTO)

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Fix interpreting list_package_contents() result (exclude constants).


0.08    2012-07-17 (SHARYANTO)

        - Do not check target module's $VERSION if we are not going to match
          version (mod_version is undef or ':all').

        - Add logging message.


0.07    2012-07-17 (SHARYANTO)

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Change patch_data format (v => 2). Currently there's no automatic
          converter for old format.

        - Relax definition for conflict: two patch modules patching the same
          subroutines does not create a conflict situation, since one just wraps
          the other. However, there are conditions which count as conflict (a
          patch module wants to delete a sub, another patch module wants to wrap
          the same sub).

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - A single patch sub can be applied to multiple target subs.

        - Provide patch_package() function to patch arbitrary package.

        - Module::Patch can be imported directly (to use patch_package()
          function) instead of having to be subclassed.


0.06    2012-07-13 (SHARYANTO)

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Error messages are now more helpful, include suggestions on how to
          remedy situation.

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Forgot to update internal data on unimport(), this caused force
          loading multiple patch modules to fail.


0.05    2012-07-12 (SHARYANTO)

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add -load_target option, defaults to true (so you no longer have to
          'use' target module first before 'use'-ing the patch module).


0.04    2012-07-12 (SHARYANTO)

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Check existence of target subroutines.

        - Allow regex in version specification.


0.03    2012-04-03 (SHARYANTO)

        - Fix conflict checking.

        - Add some tests.


0.02    2012-04-03 (SHARYANTO)

        - Support 'config' for per-patch-module configuration (see
          LWP::UserAgent::patch::https_hard_timeout for example).


0.01    2012-04-03 (SHARYANTO)

        First release. No tests yet.
